  #Although sheep's wool actually grows when they eat grass, this artificial implementation has been created to simulate the growth of their wool while offline:
  #It assumes that its wool grows when you have spent 10 minutes being offline (away from the sheep). If you return before 10 minutes, the wool has a chance to grow (the closer to 10 minutes, the higher the chance).

# OfflineGrowth can't handle it, since the plugin works for unloaded chunks. Alternatively, you can set
# disable-spawn-chunks to true, so spawn chunks are removed, and OfflineGrowth can work there. Note: setting
# this to true, disables spawn chunks for every world that is not blacklisted (see blacklisted-worlds above)
